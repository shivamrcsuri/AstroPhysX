# AstroPhysX
## **Inspiration**
We were inspired by several educative websites and platforms that engaged students in a concept when providing information and promoting learning. We were all experienced with web development languages, such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and we liked the idea of dedicating our website to physics, thus we decided to become the founders of AstroPhysX.

## **What it does**
AstroPhysX contains a game where a rocket must rotate around and avoid collision with obstacles. If the rocket is hit, a message is displayed that the player has collided and the game will restart. Additionally, our website contains and about section and physics section. The about section explains the role of the 4 crewmates in the game. The physics sections teaches the physics mechanics and concepts used in the game, thus the players are taught physics and given some familiarity with the subject.

## **How we built it**
To create the website, we used HTML, CSS, and the Selecao Bootstrap Template for layout and styling. We also used the Python Flask Module to render the templates of the html file and display the results of the code within them. For the game, we used three.js, which is a javascript game development module. We implemented physics equations into the javascript code to program the collisions and gave the rocket rectilinear motion, allowing it to rotate while the player uses the W A S D keys to move. The asteroids, planets, and rocket model were designed by us through creating shapes in javascript.

### **Shivam Suri**
I worked mainly on the website, using the Selecao Bootstrap Template, rendering the data in index.html and game.html in a python file using flask, and styling the pages of the website. I also worked with Aarya Srikanth on designing the logo for our project/organization and creating the about section of the website. I helped a little bit on the game by rendering the geometric models created by Gary Hilares.

### **Aarya Srikanth**
I worked mainly on the website with Shivam Suri, using the Selecao Bootstrap Theme to style our site and keep it professional. I also created the physics section of the website after scaling the planet and asteroid models in the game to make it easier for the user to dodge them. Finally, I decided on the name of our project with Shivam Suri and also contributed in creating the website's logo.

### **Gary Hilares**
I worked mainly on the javascript game. I created the spherical models for the planets and asteroids and the rocket model for the player to use. I also helped Nicolas Casey in implementing the physics equations that we used in three js to rotate the rocket with rectilinear motion and adding collision from the enemy objects. 

### **Nicolas Casey**
I worked on the javascript game with Gary Hilares. We created the retro geometric models that would be displayed on the players' screens and I implemented the physics equations needed for the rocket's rotational motion and the asteroids and planets' motions. Due to my knowledge of physics and mathematics, we could complete the theoretical portion of the project without any confusion, and our only recurring challenge in the process was the time constraint, which we were able to work through in the end.

## **Challenges we ran into**
One major challenge that we ran into was rendering the 3D Models that we found onto the game screen. None of us knew what to do even after research, and since there was a time factor that needed to be kept in mind, we decided to create our own spherical models for the planets and asteroids, and a custom rocket model. This would give it a "retro" look.

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**
We are proud of figuring out how to use the Selecao Bootstrap on the web development side, as none of us had prior experience with doing this. We also decided on a project idea fairly quickly and shared similar interests as teammates, thus the game development with three.js aspect was able to be completed through communication and collaboration.

## **What we learned**
We learned about rendering bootstrap templates for websites and styling these templates, along with using three.js, rendering shape objects, and implementing physics equations for rocket rotation(rectilinear motion) and more. We also learned about how to code collisions in javascript game development and improved our time utilization, which is an essential skill. 

## **What's next for AstroPhysX**
In the future, we plan on enhancing our game by improving the models that we rendered, and giving it more features such as additional planets, terrains, and the movement of the rocket's x and y position instead of only its rotation.
